# Mean-Shift-Clustering
Example of mean shift clustering in python
Mean shift clustering is a type of unsupervised algorithm. The number of clusters are decided by the algorithm itself(unlike in the case of Kmeans).The algorithm in the code first creates the clusters given the radii and then is used to predict new test point. One will
need to install onlyython for this code to be working on their machine.
